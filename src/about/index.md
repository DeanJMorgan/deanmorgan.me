# About Me

Hi there, I'm Dean. I am a Frontend Web Developer from Darwen, UK. I specialise
in building highly optimsed websites that deliver fast and reliable experiences
to its users.

# About This Site

This site is built using 11ty (eleventy), an open source static site generator
and is hosted on GitHub pages. The build process includes support for Sass
and Javascript compilation and there is also support for tests powered by Mocha.

Throughout the development of this website, I will be documenting the
development and techniques used to build this site, which will be available to
read as part of a case study series.
